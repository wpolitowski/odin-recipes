<p>
    These carrot cake bites not only for spring, but as something quick and easy you can whip up for celebrations like Easter, birthday parties, baby showers, and more! They require 9 basic ingredients (that you likely have on hand right now), 1 food processor, and just 30 minutes to make!

    They’re also naturally-sweetened, grain-free (if you’re into that kind of thing), rich in healthy fats, and flavored with health-promoting spices like ginger and cinnamon! Let’s (not) bake!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>83 g peeled and finely shredded carrot (~1-2 carrots as recipe is written)</li>
        <li>200 g packed pitted medjool dates (measured after pits are removed)</li>
        <li>210 g raw walnuts (or sub other nut, such as pecans or cashews)</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>36-54 g coconut flour (or sub almond flour)</li>
        <li>41 g raisins (<strong><em>optional</em></strong> // or sub other unsweetened dried fruit)</li>
        <br>


        <strong>For topping <em>(optional)</em></strong>
        <li>40 g desiccated coconut flakes (you can blitz briefly in a blender for a finer flake that sticks to the bites more easily)</li>
        <li>8 tsp soft, runny coconut butter (or store-bought // if hard, soften in the microwave or over the stovetop using a double boiler until pourable)</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using the grater attachment on your food processor (or a box grater), grate the carrot and set aside.</li>
        <li>To the food processor, add the pitted dates and blend until small bits remain or a ball forms. Remove from food processor and set aside.</li>
        <li>To the food processor, add walnuts, vanilla, salt, and spices. Blend until a semi-fine meal is achieved — about 15 seconds. Then add the dates and shredded carrot back in and pulse in 1-second increments until a loose dough forms and the carrots are just incorporated. Be careful not to over-blend. You’re looking for a pliable dough, not a purée.</li>
        <li>Add coconut flour 2 Tbsp (18 g) at a time and pulse to combine. If it is not mixing, you may need to remove the lid and stir occasionally to encourage things along. You’re not looking for a paste or purée here, but a tender, crumbly dough. Once well combined, add raisins (optional) and pulse/stir once more to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop out 2-Tablespoon amounts using a cookie scooper (like this one), roll into balls with hands, and place directly onto a parchment-lined baking sheet or serving platter. Repeat until all dough is used up. If the bites are too sticky to roll, add a little more coconut or almond flour to dry the mixture out.</li>
        <li>Roll in finely shredded coconut (optional) and enjoy immediately or refrigerate to chill/firm up. Or, if topping with coconut butter (optional), place bites in the freezer to chill for 10-15 minutes, then top with fresh coconut butter (if butter is not pourable, warm in a double boiler or in the microwave until a runnier consistency is achieved). After topping with coconut butter, chill bites another 5-10 minutes to set.</li>
        <li>Store covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month.</li>      

    </ol>
